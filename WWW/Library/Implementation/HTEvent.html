This module is the application interface to the multi-threaded
functionality in the Library. It contains a set of functions that the
application can either use as are or they can be overwritten by the
application. If the current implementation is kept, then the mode is
called <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Features/multithread.html#active">
Active Mode</A> of the multi-threaded model. If they are overwritten
then it is called the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Features/multithread.html#passive">
Passive Mode</A> implementation.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTEvent.c">HTEvent.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A NAME="z10"
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">Library
of Common Code</A>. <P>

<B>Note: </B>No matter of the mode used (active or passive) the module
uses a set of call-back functions. The definition of these modules are
for the application to provide. <P>

The basic elements in the model are:

<UL>

<LI>An eventloop containing a <CODE>select</CODE> function

<LI>Three sets of pending socket descriptors (READ, WRITE, INTERRUPTED)

<LI>A set of call-back functions to e defined by the application

<LI>The existent set of <A HREF="HTAccess.html#LoadDoc">load
functions</A> in the HTAccess module.

</UL>

In order to use the code in the simplest way (active mode) the
application must do the following:

<OL>

<LI>Implement a set (at least one) call-back function(s) of type
<CODE>HTEventHandler</CODE>

<LI>Register the eventhandlers using <CODE>HTEventRegister</CODE>

<LI>Implement the <CODE>HTEventRequestTerminate</CODE> call-back
function to react to the result of the request.

<LI>Call the <CODE>HTEventLoop</CODE> with parameters to load the home
document.

</OL>

<H2>Event Handlers</H2>

<B>Note: </B> application implementation <P>

The appplication registers a set of event handlers to be used on a
specified set of sockets. The eventhandlers must be defined as follows:

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTEventState {
    EVENT_OK = 0,
    EVENT_INTR,				      /* Interrupt the active thread */
    EVENT_INTR_ALL,			 /* Interrupt all registered threads */
    EVENT_TERM,			/* Force a call to HTEventRequestTerminate() */
    EVENT_QUIT						   /* QUIT eventloop */
} HTEventState;

typedef HTEventState (*HTEventHandler)	(HTRequest ** request);

typedef struct _HTEventCallBack {
    int			sockfd;
    HTEventHandler	callback;
} HTEventCallBack;
</PRE>

<A NAME="HTEventRegister"><H3>Register a User Event Handler</H3></A>

An event handler can be registered using the following function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTEventRegister	(HTEventCallBack * user_socket);
</PRE>

<H3>Cleanup Memory</H3>

The followinf functions deletes the list of registered eventhandlers
(not the structure elements themselves - only the list!

<PRE>
extern void HTEventCleanup	(void);
</PRE>

When <CODE>select</CODE> returns one of the sockets registered for
user events, for example STDIN, as ready for READ then a function of
type <CODE>HTEventHandler</CODE> is called to figure out what to do
with the event. As mentioned, it is for the client to implement these
functions, but the return codes must be as defined by
<CODE>HTEventState</CODE>. <P>

The client can use the load functions directly described in <A
HREF="HTAccess.html#LoadDoc">HTAccess Module</A> from within any of
the functions registered. <P>

When the library calls the application the request field always
contains the current request structure. The library reacts to the
return value of the eventhandler.

<H2>Terminate a thread</H2>

<B>Note: </B> client implementation <P>

This function is a callback function to the client to tell the result
of a terminated request. The functionality is the same as for one of
the <CODE>EventHandler</CODE> functions. The status code passed to the
application is equivalent to the set of codes defined for the <A
HREF="HTAccess.html#LoadDoc">load functions</A> in HTAccess.

<PRE>
extern HTEventState HTEventRequestTerminate (HTRequest *	request,
						    int		status);
</PRE>

This function can be used to update the history list, hotlist etc.


<H2>Eventloop</H2>

This is the internal socket eventloop that is executed when the client
doesn't want to have the eventloop. The client can interrupt this loop
by sending an event on one of the sockets registered for user
events. The arguments are used to load the first document (the home
page) and are supposed to make life easier for the client.

<PRE>
extern int HTEventLoop			(HTRequest *	homerequest,
			     		HTParentAnchor *	homeanchor,
					CONST char *		homekeywords);

#endif /* HTEvent_H */
