This module resisters all the plug &amp; play software modules which will
be used in the program on client side (The server has it's own initialization
module). <P>

The initialization consists of two phases: Setting up the MIME type conversions
and defining the relation between a basic set of file suffixes and MIME types. 
To override this, just copy it and link in your version before you link
with the library.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTInit.c">HTInit.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">
Library of Common Code</A>.

<H2>MIME Type Conversions</H2>

Two default functions can be used to do the MIME type initialization. The
first contains all MIME types the client can handle <B>plus</B> the types
that can be handled using save and execute calls, e.g. to start a PostScript
viewer. The second function only contains MIME type conversions that can
be handled internally in the client. As an example, the latter is used
when <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Status.html">
Line Mode Browser</A> is started in Non-Interactive mode.

<H2>File Suffix Setup</H2>

This functions defines a basic set of file suffixes and the corresponding
MIME types.
