This module contains the routines for handling the set of active
sockets currently in use by the multithreaded clients. It is an
internal module to the Library, the application interface is
implemented in the <A HREF="HTEvent.html">Event Module</A>. Look for
more information in the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Features/multithread.html">
Multithread Specifications</A>. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTThread.c">HTThread.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A NAME="z10"
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">Library
of Common Code</A>.

<A NAME="Init"><H2>Initiation</H2></A>

This function initiates the arrays of socket descriptors used in the
Library. It is currently done in the private <A
HREF="HTAccess.html#ProtReg">HTAccessInit</A> function. <P>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadInit	(void);
</PRE>

<IMG ALT="NOTE"
SRC="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Icons/32x32/caution.gif"> It is
<B>VERY</B> important that this one is called before the first
request, as otherwise the socket bit arrays are uninitialized.

<H2>Registration of a Thread</H2>

These two functions put a <A HREF="HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo
object</A> into the list of threads and takes it out again
respectively. A normal place to call these functions would be on
creation and deletion of the <CODE>HTNetInfo</CODE> data structure.

<PRE>
extern void HTThread_new	(HTNetInfo * new_net);
extern int  HTThread_clear	(HTNetInfo * old_net);
</PRE>

<H2>Get Bit-arrays for Select()</H2>

This function returns a copy of the current bit-arrays contaning the
active sockets registered for <CODE>READ</CODE> and
<CODE>WRITE</CODE>.

<PRE>
extern int HTThreadGetFDInfo 	(fd_set * read, fd_set * write);
</PRE>

<H2>Registration of the State of a Socket</H2>

When a new request is initiated from the client and a socket has been
created, is gets registered in a linked list of <A
HREF="HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo objects</A>. The object stays
in this list until the request has ended (either having an error or
success as result). Every time the program execution gets to a point
where a socket operation would normally block the program, this
function is called in order to register the socket as waiting for the
actual operation.

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTThreadAction {
    THD_SET_WRITE=0,
    THD_CLR_WRITE,
    THD_SET_READ,
    THD_CLR_READ,
    THD_SET_INTR,
    THD_CLR_INTR,
    THD_CLOSE
} HTThreadAction;
</PRE>

<PRE>
extern void HTThreadState (SOCKFD sockfd, HTThreadAction action);
</PRE>

This function makes life easier if you want to mark all sockets as
interrupted.

<PRE>
extern void HTThreadMarkIntrAll	(CONST fd_set * fd_user);
</PRE>

<H2>Is a Thread Interrupted?</H2>

This function returns YES if the socket is registered as interrupted

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadIntr	(SOCKFD sockfd);
</PRE>

<H2>Any Threads Registered?</H2>

This function returns YES if any HTTP sockets are still registered in the
set of active sockets. Otherwise it returns NO.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadActive	(void);
</PRE>

<H2>Select an Active Thread</H2>

When the <CODE>select</CODE> function has returned a set of pending
sockets this functions selects one of them and finds the
correseponding request structure.

<PRE>
extern HTRequest *HTThread_getRequest	(CONST fd_set * fd_read,
						CONST fd_set * fd_write);
