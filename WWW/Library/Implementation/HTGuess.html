This stream is a one that reads first a chunk of stuff, tries to
figure out the format, and calls <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>.  This
is a kind of lazy-evaluation of <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. <P>

This could be extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible
file formats in the world, if someone only had time to do it. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTGuess.c">HTGuess.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">
Library of Common Code</A>.
