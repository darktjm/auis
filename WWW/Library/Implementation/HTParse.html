This module contains code to parse URIs and various related things such as:

<UL>
<LI> Parse a URI relative to another URI
<LI> Get the URI relative to another URI 
<LI> Remove redundant data from the URI (HTSimplify and HTCanon)
<LI> Expand a local host name into a full domain name (HTExpand)
<LI> Search a URI for illigal characters in order to prevent security holes
</UL>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTParse.c">HTParse.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">
Library of Common Code</A>.

<H2>HTParse:  Parse a URI relative to another URI</H2>

This returns those parts of a name which are given (and requested) substituting
bits from the related name where necessary.

<H3>Control Flags for HTParse</H3>

The following are flag bits which may be ORed together to form a number
to give the 'wanted' argument to HTParse.

<PRE>
#define PARSE_ACCESS		16
#define PARSE_HOST		 8
#define PARSE_PATH		 4
#define PARSE_ANCHOR		 2
#define PARSE_PUNCTUATION	 1
#define PARSE_ALL		31
</PRE>

<H3>On entry</H3>
<DL>
<DT>aName
<DD> A filename given
<DT>relatedName
<DD> A name relative to which
aName is to be parsed
<DT>wanted
<DD> A mask for the bits which
are wanted.
</DL>

<H3>On exit,</H3>
<DL>
<DT>returns
<DD> A pointer to a malloc'd string
which MUST BE FREED
</DL>

<PRE>
extern char * HTParse  (	const char * aName,
				const char * relatedName,
				int wanted);
</PRE>

<H2>HTStrip: Strip white space off a string</H2>

<H3>On exit</H3>Return value points to first non-white
character, or to 0 if none.<P>
All trailing white space is OVERWRITTEN
with zero.

<PRE>
extern char * HTStrip (char * s);
</PRE>

<H2>HTSimplify: Simplify a UTL</H2>

A URI is allowed to contain the seqeunce xxx/../ which may be
replaced by "" , and the seqeunce "/./" which may be replaced by "/".
Simplification helps us recognize duplicate URIs. Thus, the following
transformations are done:

<UL>
<LI> /etc/junk/../fred 	becomes	/etc/fred
<LI> /etc/junk/./fred	becomes	/etc/junk/fred
</UL>

but we should NOT change
<UL>
<LI> http://fred.xxx.edu/../.. or
<LI> ../../albert.html
</UL>

In the same manner, the following prefixed are preserved:

<UL>
<LI> ./<etc>
<LI> //<etc>
</UL>

In order to avoid empty URIs the following URIs become:

<UL>
<LI> /fred/..		becomes /fred/..
<LI> /fred/././..		becomes /fred/..
<LI> /fred/.././junk/.././	becomes /fred/..
</UL>

If more than one set of `://' is found (several proxies in cascade) then
only the part after the last `://' is simplified.

<PRE>
extern char *HTSimplify (char *filename);
</PRE>


<H2>HTRelative:  Make Relative (Partial)
URI</H2>This function creates and returns
a string which gives an expression
of one address as related to another.
Where there is no relation, an absolute
address is retured.
<H3>On entry,</H3>Both names must be absolute, fully
qualified names of nodes (no anchor
bits)
<H3>On exit,</H3>The return result points to a newly
allocated name which, if parsed by
HTParse relative to relatedName,
will yield aName. The caller is responsible
for freeing the resulting name later.

<PRE>
extern char * HTRelative (const char * aName, const char *relatedName);
</PRE>

<H2>HTExpand: Expand a Local Host Name Into a Full Domain Name</H2>

This function expands the host name of the URI from a local name to a
full domain name and converts the host name to lower case. The
advantage by doing this is that we only have one entry in the host
case and one entry in the document cache.

<PRE>
extern char *HTCanon (	char **	filename,
				char *	host);
</PRE>

<H2>Prevent Security Holes</H2>

<CODE>HTCleanTelnetString()</CODE> makes sure that the given string
doesn't contain characters that could cause security holes, such as
newlines in ftp, gopher, news or telnet URLs; more specifically:
allows everything between hexadesimal ASCII 20-7E, and also A0-FE,
inclusive.
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>str</CODE>
<DD> the string that is *modified* if necessary.  The string will be
     truncated at the first illegal character that is encountered.
<DT>returns
<DD> YES, if the string was modified.
     NO, otherwise.
</DL>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTCleanTelnetString (char * str);
