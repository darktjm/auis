A Stream object is something which accepts a stream of text. See also
the <A HREF="SGML.html">Structured stream definition.</A><P>

The creation methods will vary on the type of Stream Object.  All
creation methods return a pointer to the stream type below.<P> As you
can see, but the methods used to write to the stream and close it are
pointed to be the object itself. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTStream.c">HTStream.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">
Library of Common Code</A>.

typedef struct _HTStream HTStream;

</PRE>These are the common methods of all
streams.  They should be self-explanatory,
except for end_document which must
be called before free.  It should
be merged with free in fact:  it
should be dummy for new streams.<P>

<B>NOTE: </B>The <CODE>put_block</CODE> method was <CODE>write</CODE>, but this
upset systems which had macros for <CODE>write()</CODE><P>

<B>NOTE: </B>The methods <CODE>_free</CODE> and <CODE>abort</CODE> in
the stream are now integers and not void anymore. The general return
codes from the methods are:

<UL>
<LI>Error: EOF
<LI>OK: &gt;=0
</UL>

The positive return codes can be used freely by the streams.  An
explanation on an error occured can be parsed using the <A
HREF="HTError.html">Error Module</A>.
