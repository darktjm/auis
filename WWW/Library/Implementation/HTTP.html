This is actually a very small definition file as almost everything is
set up elsewhere. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTTP.c">HTTP.c</A>, and it is a
part of the <A NAME="z10"
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">Library
of Common Code</A>. <P>

<H2>Controlling Flags</H2>

The following variables can change the behaviour of the module.

<H3>Cache control flag</H3>

<EM>Note: This variable is now replaced by the (char *) HTCacheDir in
<A HREF="HTAccess.html">HTAccess Module</A></EM> <P>

Turn this off if you don't want HTTP protocol fetches to leave cache files.
	extern	BOOL  HTCacheHTTP;

<H3>Redirections</H3>

The maximum number of redirections is pr. default 10 and is set in the
module. This prevents the library from going into an infinite loop
which is kind of nice :-)

<PRE>
extern int HTMaxRedirections;

<H3>Disable/Enable User Identification in HTTP Request</H3>

If a client want the user's email address to be send in the HTTP
request as a <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#from">
From field</A> then turn this flag on. The default is off because it
might cause security problems from within a firewall. When enabled,
the format used is <EM>user@host.domain</EM>. The value can be
changed, see <A HREF="HTTCP.html#Mailaddress">HTTCP Module</A>.

extern BOOL HTEnableFrom;
