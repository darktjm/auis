This is a simple history module for a WWW client.  It keeps a linear
history, with destructive backtrack, and list sequencing (previous,
next) operations.<P>

If you are building a client, you don't have to use this: just don't
call it.  This module is not used by any other modules in the libwww,
so if you don't refer to it you don't get it in your linked
application. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTHist.c">HTHist.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Guide/Guide.html">
Library of Common Code</A>.
