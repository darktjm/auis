        Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.

   This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our tar files.
   The package contains source code for building World-Wide Web applications
   and related reference applications. In its full contents it contains the
   source code for the following modules:
   
      Library of Common Code
      
      CERN HTTPD
      
      CERN LineMode Browser
      
      CERN Next Browser/Editor
      
Handling the Distribution Files

   These distribution files contains source code. CERN also provides a wide set
   of precompiled binaries which are available from via anonymous FTP from
   ftp.w3.org.
   
   First uncompress and untar the file <dist.tar.Z> is the specific
   distribution file:
   
        uncompress <dist.tar.Z>

   Then untar the file by typing
   
        tar xf <dist.tar>

Generated Directory structure

   The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this) directory.
   They create different parts of a common directory tree under that directory.
   There may be some duplication. They also generate a few files in this
   directory: README, COPYRIGH, and some installation instructions. The
   structure of the untar'ed package is as follows (directories):
   
        WWW                             Top-node

        WWW/All                         Platform dependent make files

        WWW/Library                     Library of Common Code
        WWW/Library/Implementation      Source Code
        WWW/Library/*                   Platform dependent object files

        WWW/Daemon                      CERN HTTPD
        WWW/Daemon/Implementation       Source Code
        WWW/Daemon/*                    Platform dependent object files

        WWW/LineMode                    CERN LineMode Browser
        WWW/LineMode/Implementation     Source Code
        WWW/LineMode/*                  Platform dependent object files

        WWW/Next                        CERN Next Browser/Editor
        WWW/Next/Implementation         Source Code
        WWW/Next/*                      Platform dependent object files

   Some or more of these directories might not be there. This depends on the
   number of distribution files. In general there is one distribution file pr.
   module (Library, LineMode Browser, and Daemon). The Library distribution
   file is required for all the other module.
   
Compilation on already supported platforms

   To BUILD any of the applications go to the WWW directory and type
   
        ./BUILD library

        ./BUILD daemon

        ./BUILD linemode

   or simply
   
        ./BUILD

   in order to BUILD all applications
   
Library of Common Code

   The CERN World-Wide Web Library of Common Code is a general code base that
   can be used to build clients and servers. It contains code for accessing
   HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system.
   Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting
   hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic programming
   utilities. The Library is the basis for many World-Wide Web applications and
   all the CERN WWW software is build on top of it. The Library is a required
   part of all other CERN WWW applications in this distribution.
   
   Online documentation is available
   http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html. If you don't have a WWW
   client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no userid or password required) and you
   will get the Line Mode Browser.
   
LineMode Browser

   The CERN Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web Browser.  It
   is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for the CERN
   Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non- interactive
   mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety of possibilities
   for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a
   test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in batch jobs.
   
   Installation is very simple as the application can run without any
   particular seup. You can specify your own HOME PAGE using the WWW_HOME
   environment variable. Remember toy setup a NNTPSERVER environment variable
   before you try to access a news server.
   
   Online documentation is available
   http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Status.html. If you don't have a
   WWW client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no userid or password required) and
   you will get the Line Mode Browser.
   
Server

   CERN httpd is a generic public domain full-featured hypertext server which
   can be used as a regular HTTP server. The running typically on port 80 to
   serve hypertext and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a
   firewall machine -- that provides access for people inside a firewall to the
   outside world. When running as proxy httpd may be configured to do caching
   of documents resulting in faster response times.
   
   Follow instructions above for compiling and then go on to " Installing the
   basic W3 server".
   
   Online documentation is available
   http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html. If you don't have a WWW
   client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no userid or password required) and you
   will get the Line Mode Browser.
   
NeXTStep Browser/Editor

   The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application
   directory WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is compiled. When you
   install the app, you may want to configure the default page,
   WorldWideWeb.app/default.html. These must point to some useful information!
   You should keep it up to date with pointers to info on your site and
   elsewhere. If you use the CERN home page note there is a link at the bottom
   to the master copy on our server. You should set up the address of your
   local news server with
   
        dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost news

   replacing the last word with the actual address of your news host. See
   Installation instructions.
   
   Online documentation is available
   http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Next/Status.html. If you don't have a WWW
   client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no userid or password required) and you
   will get the Line Mode Browser.

General

   Your comments will of course be most appreciated, on code, or information on
   the web which is out of date or misleading. If you write your own hypertext
   and make it available by anonymous ftp or using a server, tell us and we'll
   put some pointers to it in ours. Thus spreads the web...
   
   Have fun!
