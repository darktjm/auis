- org/treev: unfolded expands to left & right, but doesn't shift left
  side if needed (i.e., left is severely cut off) if lots of items,
  and lots of blank space to right (similar for horizontal, but for some
  reason it allows moving scrollbar into negative area)
- scrolling fixes:
  - enable scroll wheel
  - continuous update when dragging bar
- fix lack of updates when resizing windows
- fix pseudo-tty allocation to use ptmx (overhead/util/lib/getpty.c)
- fix contrib/tm to use termios, etc.
- tests all apps, all insets, all docs, etc.
  - squash any crashes
  - run valgrind on as much as possible
  - fix example docs to document C++-style code
  - find out purpose of every file installed in auis, and document
- general cleanup:
  - get rid of csh usage for scripts (sh is better)
  - remove all warnings
  - remove externs in c files
  - remove all statics in header files, if possible (gads, help.h is awful)
  - remove type casts if possible
  - constify pointers if possible
    There's almost never a good reason to cast pointers (well, in C++,
    you have to cast void * to the destination type, but that's it).
      gcc has no "flag all explicit casts" warning flag.
      -Wint-conversion (on by default)
      -Wbad-function-cast
      -Wcast-qual
      -Wcast-align
      -Wconversion
      -Wuseless-cast
      -Wsign-conversion
      -Wfloat-conversion
      -Wint-to-pointer-cast (on by default)
      -Wpointer-to-int-cast (on by default)
    It's usually better to make structures const by default and cast them to
    non-const when known to be malloc'd than the other way around
      e.g. ErrorGuts() -> only cast if explicit free flag given
    The only exception is when one statically allocated structure uses
    constants, but all else is malloc'd.
      e.g. filetype.C: mapEntry.fileExtension
  - remove any unsupportable code (i.e., old UNIX, DOS, OS/2)
  - remove any functions which duplicate standard functions (e.g. strdup)
- find out and possibly remove additional CMU/MIT-specific crap
  - figure out what "AFS integration" means
  - find out what AMS is/does and maybe drop it
  - remove all packages available elsewhere; e.g. metamail, rpc, jpeg, tiff
    (making sure there is no afs/atk "enhancement" first)
- build improvements
  - make it possible to build w/o simultaneous install
  - make it possible to use -k and -j
  - don't always regenerate deps, and clean up dep generation
  - maybe just switch to cmake
- fix UniquiID() and friends:
  - try not to renumber everything every modification; messes up svn diff
  - try to limit to 32 bits to retain compatibility with older systems

Long-term:
  - more image::WriteNative overrides (at least 1 full-color lossless)
  - add support for png and/or imagemagick or some other wrapper library
    and make png default instead of gif
  - add code snippet inset for literate programming
  - make LaTeX the default output format
  - unicode support
  - truetype font support
  - make index entries insets
  - make entire beast literate
  - undo
  - freedesktop.org integration
