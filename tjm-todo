- figure out why pref existence shrinks windows:
    default is 500x500, but I had 1280x1024 in ~/.Xdefaults (which is
    ignored when .preferences exists)
- org: graphic update on delete and rename is broken (requires ctrl-L)
  issue appears to be in observer of treev.C
- whichdo doesn't recognize static objects
- scrolling fixes:
  - enable scroll wheel
  - continuous update when dragging bar
- fix lack of updates when resizing windows
- fix pseudo-tty allocation to use ptmx (overhead/util/lib/getpty.c)
- fix contrib/tm to use termios, etc.
- tests all apps, all insets, all docs, etc.
  - squash any crashes
  - run valgrind on as much as possible
  - fix example docs to document C++-style code
  - find out purpose of every file installed in auis, and document
- general cleanup:
  - remove all warnings
  - remove externs in c files
  - remove type casts if possible
  - constify pointers if possible
  - remove any unsupportable code (i.e., old UNIX, DOS, OS/2)
  - remove any functions which duplicate standard functions (e.g. strdup)
- find out and possibly remove additional CMU/MIT-specific crap
  - figure out what "AFS integration" means
  - find out what AMS is/does and maybe drop it
- build improvements
  - make it possible to build w/o simultaneous install
  - make it possible to use -k and -j
  - don't always regenerate deps, and clean up dep generation
  - maybe just switch to cmake

Long-term:
  - more image::WriteNative overrides (at least 1 full-color lossless)
  - add support for png and/or imagemagick or some other wrapper library
  - add code snippet inset for literate programming
  - make LaTeX the default output format
  - unicode support
  - truetype font support
  - make index entries insets
  - make entire beast literate
  - undo
  - freedesktop.org integration
