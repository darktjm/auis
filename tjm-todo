- org/treev: unfolded expands size, but doesn't shift tree to right
  if needed (i.e., left is severely cut off).  Also doesn't shift tree down
  for horizontal arrangement, but for some reason it allows moving scrollbar
  into negative area)
- scrolling fixes:
  - enable scroll wheel
  - continuous update when dragging bar
- fix lack of updates when resizing windows
- fix contrib/tm to use termios, etc.
- tests all apps, all insets, all docs, etc.
  - squash any crashes
  - run valgrind on as much as possible
  - fix example docs to document C++-style code
  - find out purpose of every file installed in auis, and document
- general cleanup:
  - get rid of csh usage for scripts (sh is better)
  - remove all warnings
  - remove externs in c files
  - remove all statics in header files, if possible (gads, help.h is awful)
  - constify pointers if possible
    It's usually better to make structures const by default and cast them to
    non-const when known to be malloc'd than the other way around
      e.g. ErrorGuts() -> only cast if explicit free flag given
    The only exception is when one statically allocated structure uses
    constants, but all else is malloc'd.
      e.g. filetype.C: mapEntry.fileExtension
  - remove type casts if possible
    There's almost never a good reason to cast pointers (well, in C++,
    you have to cast void * to the destination type, but that's it).
      gcc has no "flag all explicit casts" warning flag.
      -Wint-conversion (on by default)
      -Wbad-function-cast
      -Wcast-qual
      -Wcast-align
      -Wconversion
      -Wuseless-cast
      -Wsign-conversion
      -Wfloat-conversion
      -Wint-to-pointer-cast (on by default)
      -Wpointer-to-int-cast (on by default)
  - remove any unsupportable code (i.e., old UNIX, DOS, OS/2)
  - remove any functions which duplicate standard functions (e.g. strdup)
- find out and possibly remove additional CMU/MIT-specific crap
  - remove all packages available elsewhere; e.g. peg, tiff
    (making sure there is no afs/atk "enhancement" first)
- build improvements
  - make it possible to build w/o simultaneous install
    It's possible to do "make Makefiles; make All", but some places depend
      on libs/headers from previous dirs to be installed
  - make it possible to use -k and -j (-k mostly works now)
  - fix corruption of flags (empty flags become -- eventually)
  - don't always regenerate deps, and clean up dep generation
  - maybe just switch to cmake
- fix UniquiID() and friends:
  - try not to renumber everything every modification; messes up svn diff
  - try to limit to 32 bits to retain compatibility with older systems
- pass unknown keys up the view hierarchy (e.g. pgup within inset often fails)

Long-term:
  - more image::WriteNative overrides (at least 1 full-color lossless)
  - add support for png and/or imagemagick or some other wrapper library
    and make png default instead of gif
  - add code snippet inset for literate programming
  - make LaTeX the default output format
  - unicode support
  - truetype font support
  - make index entries insets
  - make entire beast literate
  - undo
  - freedesktop.org integration
  - look at removed mail-related stuff to see if anything useful got deleted
    (e.g. ez2ascii claims descendence from messages)
  - look at auis-6.3.1 to see if anything useful got dropped in 8.0
