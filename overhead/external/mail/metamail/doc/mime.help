.SH DESCRIPTION
.I MIME
is the official proposed standard format for extended Internet electronic mail.  The MIME format permits email to include enhanced text, graphics, audio, and more, in a standardized and interoperable manner.  If you send and receive mail with a MIME-compliant mail system, you will be able to send and receive far more than ASCII text.

Various different people and companies are implementing MIME-compliant software.  This man page was provided, by user request, as part of the freely-available "metamail" distribution from Bellcore.  Metamail provides a complete MIME implementation, but there may well be others at your site, too.  The "SEE ALSO" section only refers to the tools that came as part of the metamail distribution.
