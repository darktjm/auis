Reduce/Reduce Conflicts
=======================

   A reduce/reduce conflict occurs if there are two or more rules that
apply to the same sequence of input.  This usually indicates a serious
error in the grammar.

   For example, here is an erroneous attempt to define a sequence of
zero or more `word' groupings.

     sequence: /* empty */
                     { printf ("empty sequence\n"); }
             | maybeword
             | sequence word
                     { printf ("added word %s\n", $2); }
             ;
     
     maybeword: /* empty */
                     { printf ("empty maybeword\n"); }
             | word
                     { printf ("single word %s\n", $1); }
             ;

The error is an ambiguity: there is more than one way to parse a single
`word' into a `sequence'.  It could be reduced to a `maybeword' and
then into a `sequence' via the second rule.  Alternatively,
nothing-at-all could be reduced into a `sequence' via the first rule,
and this could be combined with the `word' using the third rule for
`sequence'.

   There is also more than one way to reduce nothing-at-all into a
`sequence'.  This can be done directly via the first rule, or
indirectly via `maybeword' and then the second rule.

   You might think that this is a distinction without a difference,
because it does not change whether any particular input is valid or
not.  But it does affect which actions are run.  One parsing order runs
the second rule's action; the other runs the first rule's action and
the third rule's action.  In this example, the output of the program
changes.

   Bison resolves a reduce/reduce conflict by choosing to use the rule
that appears first in the grammar, but it is very risky to rely on
this.  Every reduce/reduce conflict must be studied and usually
eliminated.  Here is the proper way to define `sequence':

     sequence: /* empty */
                     { printf ("empty sequence\n"); }
             | sequence word
                     { printf ("added word %s\n", $2); }
             ;

   Here is another common error that yields a reduce/reduce conflict:

     sequence: /* empty */
             | sequence words
             | sequence redirects
             ;
     
     words:    /* empty */
             | words word
             ;
     
     redirects:/* empty */
             | redirects redirect
             ;

The intention here is to define a sequence which can contain either
`word' or `redirect' groupings.  The individual definitions of
`sequence', `words' and `redirects' are error-free, but the three
together make a subtle ambiguity: even an empty input can be parsed in
infinitely many ways!

   Consider: nothing-at-all could be a `words'.  Or it could be two
`words' in a row, or three, or any number.  It could equally well be a
`redirects', or two, or any number.  Or it could be a `words' followed
by three `redirects' and another `words'.  And so on.

   Here are two ways to correct these rules.  First, to make it a
single level of sequence:

     sequence: /* empty */
             | sequence word
             | sequence redirect
             ;

   Second, to prevent either a `words' or a `redirects' from being
empty:

     sequence: /* empty */
             | sequence words
             | sequence redirects
             ;
     
     words:    word
             | words word
             ;
     
     redirects:redirect
             | redirects redirect
             ;

Mysterious Reduce/Reduce Conflicts
==================================

   Sometimes reduce/reduce conflicts can occur that don't look
warranted.  Here is an example:

     %token ID
     
     %%
     def:    param_spec return_spec ','
             ;
     param_spec:
                  type
             |    name_list ':' type
             ;
     return_spec:
                  type
             |    name ':' type
             ;
     type:        ID
             ;
     name:        ID
             ;
     name_list:
                  name
             |    name ',' name_list
             ;

   It would seem that this grammar can be parsed with only a single
token of look-ahead: when a `param_spec' is being read, an `ID' is a
`name' if a comma or colon follows, or a `type' if another `ID'
follows.  In other words, this grammar is LR(1).

   However, Bison, like most parser generators, cannot actually handle
all LR(1) grammars.  In this grammar, two contexts, that after an `ID'
at the beginning of a `param_spec' and likewise at the beginning of a
`return_spec', are similar enough that Bison assumes they are the same.
They appear similar because the same set of rules would be active--the
rule for reducing to a `name' and that for reducing to a `type'.  Bison
is unable to determine at that stage of processing that the rules would
require different look-ahead tokens in the two contexts, so it makes a
single parser state for them both.  Combining the two contexts causes a
conflict later.  In parser terminology, this occurrence means that the
grammar is not LALR(1).

   In general, it is better to fix deficiencies than to document them.
But this particular deficiency is intrinsically hard to fix; parser
generators that can handle LR(1) grammars are hard to write and tend to
produce parsers that are very large.  In practice, Bison is more useful
as it is now.

   When the problem arises, you can often fix it by identifying the two
parser states that are being confused, and adding something to make them
look distinct.  In the above example, adding one rule to `return_spec'
as follows makes the problem go away:

     %token BOGUS
     ...
     %%
     ...
     return_spec:
                  type
             |    name ':' type
             /* This rule is never used.  */
             |    ID BOGUS
             ;

   This corrects the problem because it introduces the possibility of an
additional active rule in the context after the `ID' at the beginning of
`return_spec'.  This rule is not active in the corresponding context in
a `param_spec', so the two contexts receive distinct parser states.  As
long as the token `BOGUS' is never generated by `yylex', the added rule
cannot alter the way actual input is parsed.

   In this particular example, there is another way to solve the
problem: rewrite the rule for `return_spec' to use `ID' directly
instead of via `name'.  This also causes the two confusing contexts to
have different sets of active rules, because the one for `return_spec'
activates the altered rule for `return_spec' rather than the one for
`name'.

     param_spec:
                  type
             |    name_list ':' type
             ;
     return_spec:
                  type
             |    ID ':' type
             ;

Stack Overflow, and How to Avoid It
===================================

   The Bison parser stack can overflow if too many tokens are shifted
and not reduced.  When this happens, the parser function `yyparse'
returns a nonzero value, pausing only to call `yyerror' to report the
overflow.

   By defining the macro `YYMAXDEPTH', you can control how deep the
parser stack can become before a stack overflow occurs.  Define the
macro with a value that is an integer.  This value is the maximum number
of tokens that can be shifted (and not reduced) before overflow.  It
must be a constant expression whose value is known at compile time.

   The stack space allowed is not necessarily allocated.  If you
specify a large value for `YYMAXDEPTH', the parser actually allocates a
small stack at first, and then makes it bigger by stages as needed.
This increasing allocation happens automatically and silently.
Therefore, you do not need to make `YYMAXDEPTH' painfully small merely
to save space for ordinary inputs that do not need much stack.

   The default value of `YYMAXDEPTH', if you do not define it, is 10000.

   You can control how much stack is allocated initially by defining the
macro `YYINITDEPTH'.  This value too must be a compile-time constant
integer.  The default is 200.

Error Recovery
**************

   It is not usually acceptable to have a program terminate on a parse
error.  For example, a compiler should recover sufficiently to parse the
rest of the input file and check it for errors; a calculator should
accept another expression.

   In a simple interactive command parser where each input is one line,
it may be sufficient to allow `yyparse' to return 1 on error and have
the caller ignore the rest of the input line when that happens (and
then call `yyparse' again).  But this is inadequate for a compiler,
because it forgets all the syntactic context leading up to the error.
A syntax error deep within a function in the compiler input should not
cause the compiler to treat the following line like the beginning of a
source file.

   You can define how to recover from a syntax error by writing rules to
recognize the special token `error'.  This is a terminal symbol that is
always defined (you need not declare it) and reserved for error
handling.  The Bison parser generates an `error' token whenever a
syntax error happens; if you have provided a rule to recognize this
token in the current context, the parse can continue.

   For example:

     stmnts:  /* empty string */
             | stmnts '\n'
             | stmnts exp '\n'
             | stmnts error '\n'

   The fourth rule in this example says that an error followed by a
newline makes a valid addition to any `stmnts'.

   What happens if a syntax error occurs in the middle of an `exp'?  The
error recovery rule, interpreted strictly, applies to the precise
sequence of a `stmnts', an `error' and a newline.  If an error occurs in
the middle of an `exp', there will probably be some additional tokens
and subexpressions on the stack after the last `stmnts', and there will
be tokens to read before the next newline.  So the rule is not
applicable in the ordinary way.

   But Bison can force the situation to fit the rule, by discarding
part of the semantic context and part of the input.  First it discards
states and objects from the stack until it gets back to a state in
which the `error' token is acceptable.  (This means that the
subexpressions already parsed are discarded, back to the last complete
`stmnts'.)  At this point the `error' token can be shifted.  Then, if
the old look-ahead token is not acceptable to be shifted next, the
parser reads tokens and discards them until it finds a token which is
acceptable.  In this example, Bison reads and discards input until the
next newline so that the fourth rule can apply.

   The choice of error rules in the grammar is a choice of strategies
for error recovery.  A simple and useful strategy is simply to skip the
rest of the current input line or current statement if an error is
detected:

     stmnt: error ';'  /* on error, skip until ';' is read */

   It is also useful to recover to the matching close-delimiter of an
opening-delimiter that has already been parsed.  Otherwise the
close-delimiter will probably appear to be unmatched, and generate
another, spurious error message:

     primary:  '(' expr ')'
             | '(' error ')'
             ...
             ;

   Error recovery strategies are necessarily guesses.  When they guess
wrong, one syntax error often leads to another.  In the above example,
the error recovery rule guesses that an error is due to bad input
within one `stmnt'.  Suppose that instead a spurious semicolon is
inserted in the middle of a valid `stmnt'.  After the error recovery
rule recovers from the first error, another syntax error will be found
straightaway, since the text following the spurious semicolon is also
an invalid `stmnt'.

   To prevent an outpouring of error messages, the parser will output
no error message for another syntax error that happens shortly after
the first; only after three consecutive input tokens have been
successfully shifted will error messages resume.

   Note that rules which accept the `error' token may have actions, just
as any other rules can.

   You can make error messages resume immediately by using the macro
`yyerrok' in an action.  If you do this in the error rule's action, no
error messages will be suppressed.  This macro requires no arguments;
`yyerrok;' is a valid C statement.

   The previous look-ahead token is reanalyzed immediately after an
error.  If this is unacceptable, then the macro `yyclearin' may be used
to clear this token.  Write the statement `yyclearin;' in the error
rule's action.

   For example, suppose that on a parse error, an error handling
routine is called that advances the input stream to some point where
parsing should once again commence.  The next symbol returned by the
lexical scanner is probably correct.  The previous look-ahead token
ought to be discarded with `yyclearin;'.

   The macro `YYRECOVERING' stands for an expression that has the value
1 when the parser is recovering from a syntax error, and 0 the rest of
the time.  A value of 1 indicates that error messages are currently
suppressed for new syntax errors.

Handling Context Dependencies
*****************************

   The Bison paradigm is to parse tokens first, then group them into
larger syntactic units.  In many languages, the meaning of a token is
affected by its context.  Although this violates the Bison paradigm,
certain techniques (known as "kludges") may enable you to write Bison
parsers for such languages.

* Menu:

* Semantic Tokens::   Token parsing can depend on the semantic context.
* Lexical Tie-ins::   Token parsing can depend on the syntactic context.
* Tie-in Recovery::   Lexical tie-ins have implications for how
                        error recovery rules must be written.

   (Actually, "kludge" means any technique that gets its job done but is
neither clean nor robust.)


File: bison.info,  Node: Semantic Tokens,  Next: Lexical Tie-ins,  Up: Context Dependency

Semantic Info in Token Types
============================

   The C language has a context dependency: the way an identifier is
used depends on what its current meaning is.  For example, consider
this:

     foo (x);

   This looks like a function call statement, but if `foo' is a typedef
name, then this is actually a declaration of `x'.  How can a Bison
parser for C decide how to parse this input?

   The method used in GNU C is to have two different token types,
`IDENTIFIER' and `TYPENAME'.  When `yylex' finds an identifier, it
looks up the current declaration of the identifier in order to decide
which token type to return: `TYPENAME' if the identifier is declared as
a typedef, `IDENTIFIER' otherwise.

   The grammar rules can then express the context dependency by the
choice of token type to recognize.  `IDENTIFIER' is accepted as an
expression, but `TYPENAME' is not.  `TYPENAME' can start a declaration,
but `IDENTIFIER' cannot.  In contexts where the meaning of the
identifier is *not* significant, such as in declarations that can
shadow a typedef name, either `TYPENAME' or `IDENTIFIER' is
accepted--there is one rule for each of the two token types.

   This technique is simple to use if the decision of which kinds of
identifiers to allow is made at a place close to where the identifier is
parsed.  But in C this is not always so: C allows a declaration to
redeclare a typedef name provided an explicit type has been specified
earlier:

     typedef int foo, bar, lose;
     static foo (bar);        /* redeclare `bar' as static variable */
     static int foo (lose);   /* redeclare `foo' as function */

   Unfortunately, the name being declared is separated from the
declaration construct itself by a complicated syntactic structure--the
"declarator".

   As a result, the part of Bison parser for C needs to be duplicated,
with all the nonterminal names changed: once for parsing a declaration
in which a typedef name can be redefined, and once for parsing a
declaration in which that can't be done.  Here is a part of the
duplication, with actions omitted for brevity:

     initdcl:
               declarator maybeasm '='
               init
             | declarator maybeasm
             ;
     
     notype_initdcl:
               notype_declarator maybeasm '='
               init
             | notype_declarator maybeasm
             ;

Here `initdcl' can redeclare a typedef name, but `notype_initdcl'
cannot.  The distinction between `declarator' and `notype_declarator'
is the same sort of thing.

   There is some similarity between this technique and a lexical tie-in
(described next), in that information which alters the lexical analysis
is changed during parsing by other parts of the program.  The
difference is here the information is global, and is used for other
purposes in the program.  A true lexical tie-in has a special-purpose
flag controlled by the syntactic context.


File: bison.info,  Node: Lexical Tie-ins,  Next: Tie-in Recovery,  Prev: Semantic Tokens,  Up: Context Dependency

Lexical Tie-ins
===============

   One way to handle context-dependency is the "lexical tie-in": a flag
which is set by Bison actions, whose purpose is to alter the way tokens
are parsed.

   For example, suppose we have a language vaguely like C, but with a
special construct `hex (HEX-EXPR)'.  After the keyword `hex' comes an
expression in parentheses in which all integers are hexadecimal.  In
particular, the token `a1b' must be treated as an integer rather than
as an identifier if it appears in that context.  Here is how you can do
it:

     %{
     int hexflag;
     %}
     %%
     ...
     expr:   IDENTIFIER
             | constant
             | HEX '('
                     { hexflag = 1; }
               expr ')'
                     { hexflag = 0;
                        $$ = $4; }
             | expr '+' expr
                     { $$ = make_sum ($1, $3); }
             ...
             ;
     
     constant:
               INTEGER
             | STRING
             ;

Here we assume that `yylex' looks at the value of `hexflag'; when it is
nonzero, all integers are parsed in hexadecimal, and tokens starting
with letters are parsed as integers if possible.

   The declaration of `hexflag' shown in the C declarations section of
the parser file is needed to make it accessible to the actions (*note
The C Declarations Section: C Declarations.).  You must also write the
code in `yylex' to obey the flag.


File: bison.info,  Node: Tie-in Recovery,  Prev: Lexical Tie-ins,  Up: Context Dependency

Lexical Tie-ins and Error Recovery
==================================

   Lexical tie-ins make strict demands on any error recovery rules you
have.  *Note Error Recovery::.

   The reason for this is that the purpose of an error recovery rule is
to abort the parsing of one construct and resume in some larger
construct.  For example, in C-like languages, a typical error recovery
rule is to skip tokens until the next semicolon, and then start a new
statement, like this:

     stmt:   expr ';'
             | IF '(' expr ')' stmt { ... }
             ...
             error ';'
                     { hexflag = 0; }
             ;

   If there is a syntax error in the middle of a `hex (EXPR)'
construct, this error rule will apply, and then the action for the
completed `hex (EXPR)' will never run.  So `hexflag' would remain set
for the entire rest of the input, or until the next `hex' keyword,
causing identifiers to be misinterpreted as integers.

   To avoid this problem the error recovery rule itself clears
`hexflag'.

   There may also be an error recovery rule that works within
expressions.  For example, there could be a rule which applies within
parentheses and skips to the close-parenthesis:

     expr:   ...
             | '(' expr ')'
                     { $$ = $2; }
             | '(' error ')'
             ...

   If this rule acts within the `hex' construct, it is not going to
abort that construct (since it applies to an inner level of parentheses
within the construct).  Therefore, it should not clear the flag: the
rest of the `hex' construct should be parsed with the flag still in
effect.

   What if there is an error recovery rule which might abort out of the
`hex' construct or might not, depending on circumstances?  There is no
way you can write the action to determine whether a `hex' construct is
being aborted or not.  So if you are using a lexical tie-in, you had
better make sure your error recovery rules are not of this kind.  Each
rule must be such that you can be sure that it always will, or always
won't, have to clear the flag.

Debugging Your Parser
*********************

   If a Bison grammar compiles properly but doesn't do what you want
when it runs, the `yydebug' parser-trace feature can help you figure
out why.

   To enable compilation of trace facilities, you must define the macro
`YYDEBUG' when you compile the parser.  You could use `-DYYDEBUG=1' as
a compiler option or you could put `#define YYDEBUG 1' in the C
declarations section of the grammar file (*note The C Declarations
Section: C Declarations.).  Alternatively, use the `-t' option when you
run Bison (*note Invoking Bison: Invocation.).  We always define
`YYDEBUG' so that debugging is always possible.

   The trace facility uses `stderr', so you must add
`#include <stdio.h>' to the C declarations section unless it is already
there.

   Once you have compiled the program with trace facilities, the way to
request a trace is to store a nonzero value in the variable `yydebug'.
You can do this by making the C code do it (in `main', perhaps), or you
can alter the value with a C debugger.

   Each step taken by the parser when `yydebug' is nonzero produces a
line or two of trace information, written on `stderr'.  The trace
messages tell you these things:

   * Each time the parser calls `yylex', what kind of token was read.

   * Each time a token is shifted, the depth and complete contents of
     the state stack (*note Parser States::.).

   * Each time a rule is reduced, which rule it is, and the complete
     contents of the state stack afterward.

   To make sense of this information, it helps to refer to the listing
file produced by the Bison `-v' option (*note Invoking Bison:
Invocation.).  This file shows the meaning of each state in terms of
positions in various rules, and also what each state will do with each
possible input token.  As you read the successive trace messages, you
can see that the parser is functioning according to its specification
in the listing file.  Eventually you will arrive at the place where
something undesirable happens, and you will see which parts of the
grammar are to blame.

   The parser file is a C program and you can use C debuggers on it,
but it's not easy to interpret what it is doing.  The parser function
is a finite-state machine interpreter, and aside from the actions it
executes the same code over and over.  Only the values of variables
show where in the grammar it is working.

   The debugging information normally gives the token type of each token
read, but not its semantic value.  You can optionally define a macro
named `YYPRINT' to provide a way to print the value.  If you define
`YYPRINT', it should take three arguments.  The parser will pass a
standard I/O stream, the numeric code for the token type, and the token
value (from `yylval').

   Here is an example of `YYPRINT' suitable for the multi-function
calculator (*note Declarations for `mfcalc': Mfcalc Decl.):

     #define YYPRINT(file, type, value)   yyprint (file, type, value)
     
     static void
     yyprint (file, type, value)

Invoking Bison
**************

   The usual way to invoke Bison is as follows:

     bison INFILE

   Here INFILE is the grammar file name, which usually ends in `.y'.
The parser file's name is made by replacing the `.y' with `.tab.c'.
Thus, the `bison foo.y' filename yields `foo.tab.c', and the `bison
hack/foo.y' filename yields `hack/foo.tab.c'.

Bison Options
=============

   Bison supports both traditional single-letter options and mnemonic
long option names.  Long option names are indicated with `--' instead of
`-'.  Abbreviations for option names are allowed as long as they are
unique.  When a long option takes an argument, like `--file-prefix',
connect the option name and the argument with `='.

   Some options can also be specified within the grammar file as %
declarations (*note The Bison Declarations Section: Bison
Declarations.).  The declaration name is the same as the long option
name, but with dashes changed to underscores.  The % declaration is
shown in the list below for the affected options.

   Here is a list of options that can be used with Bison, alphabetized
by short option.  It is followed by a cross key alphabetized by long
option.

`-b FILE-PREFIX'
`--file-prefix=PREFIX'
     Specify a prefix to use for all Bison output file names.  The
     names are chosen as if the input file were named `PREFIX.c'.

`-d'
`--defines'
     Write an extra output file containing macro definitions for the
     token type names defined in the grammar and the semantic value type
     `YYSTYPE', as well as a few `extern' variable declarations.

     If the parser output file is named `NAME.c' then this file is
     named `NAME.h'.

     This output file is essential if you wish to put the definition of
     `yylex' in a separate source file, because `yylex' needs to be
     able to refer to token type codes and the variable `yylval'.
     *Note Semantic Values of Tokens: Token Values.

`-k'
`--token-table'
`%token_table'
     This switch causes the .tab.c output to include a list of token
     names in order by their token numbers;  this is defined in the
     array `yytname'.  The first three elements are `"$"', `"error"',
     and `"$illegal"';  entries for single- and multi-character symbols
     include their quotes: `"\'+\'"' and `"\"<=\""'.   Also generated
     are #defines for `YYNTOKENS, YYNNTS, YYNRULES', and `YYNSTATES'
     giving, respectively, one more than the highest token number, the
     number of non-terminal symbols, the number of grammar rules, and
     the number of states.

`-l'
`--no-lines'
`%no_lines'
     Don't put any `#line' preprocessor commands in the parser file.
     Ordinarily Bison puts them in the parser file so that the C
     compiler and debuggers will associate errors with your source
     file, the grammar file.  This option causes them to associate
     errors with the parser file, treating it an independent source
     file in its own right.

`-n'
`--no-parser'
     Do not generate the parser code into the output;  generate only
     declarations.  The generated `y.tab.c' file will have only
     constant declarations.  In addition, a FILENAME.act file is
     generated containing a switch statement body containing all the
     translated actions.  (The FILENAME is taken from the input file or
     set in accordance with the -o switch.)  The declarations in the
     FILENAME`.tab.c' file will all be static or #defined.  Some
     symbols only appear if appropriate options are selected.  These
     are #defined:   YYLTYPE, YYFINAL, YYFLAG, YYNTBASE, YYTRANSLATE,
     YYLAST, YYNTOKENS, YYNNTS, YYNRULES, YYNSTATES, YYMAXUTOK.  These
     are declared and given values:  yyltype, yytranslate, yyprhs,
     yyrhs, yystos, yyrline, yytname, yytoknum, yyr1, yyr2, yydefact,
     yydefgoto, yypact, yypgoto, yytable, and yycheck.  See the source
     file output.c for definitions of these variables.

`-o OUTFILE'
`--output-file=OUTFILE'
     Specify the name OUTFILE for the parser file.

     The other output files' names are constructed from OUTFILE as
     described under the `-v' and `-d' options.

`-p PREFIX'
`--name-prefix=PREFIX'
     Rename the external symbols used in the parser so that they start
     with PREFIX instead of `yy'.  The precise list of symbols renamed
     is `yyparse', `yylex', `yyerror', `yynerrs', `yylval', `yychar'
     and `yydebug'.

     For example, if you use `-p c', the names become `cparse', `clex',
     and so on.

     *Note Multiple Parsers in the Same Program: Multiple Parsers.

`-r'
`--raw'
`%raw'
     In the output to `NAME.h' the tokens are usually defined with Yacc
     compatible token numbers.  If this switch is specified, the Bison
     assigned numbers are output instead.   (Yacc numbers start at 257
     except for single character tokens;  Bison assigns token numbers
     sequentially for all tokens starting at 3.)

`-t'
`--debug'
     Output a definition of the macro `YYDEBUG' into the parser file,
     so that the debugging facilities are compiled.  *Note Debugging
     Your Parser: Debugging.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Write an extra output file containing verbose descriptions of the
     parser states and what is done for each type of look-ahead token in
     that state.

     This file also describes all the conflicts, both those resolved by
     operator precedence and the unresolved ones.

     The file's name is made by removing `.tab.c' or `.c' from the
     parser output file name, and adding `.output' instead.

     Therefore, if the input file is `foo.y', then the parser file is
     called `foo.tab.c' by default.  As a consequence, the verbose
     output file is called `foo.output'.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print the version number of Bison and exit.

`-h'
`--help'
     Print a summary of the command-line options to Bison and exit.

`-y'
`--yacc'
`--fixed-output-files'
     Equivalent to `-o y.tab.c'; the parser output file is called
     `y.tab.c', and the other outputs are called `y.output' and
     `y.tab.h'.  The purpose of this switch is to imitate Yacc's output
     file name conventions.  Thus, the following shell script can
     substitute for Yacc:

          bison -y $*

Invoking Bison under VMS
========================

   The command line syntax for Bison on VMS is a variant of the usual
Bison command syntax--adapted to fit VMS conventions.

   To find the VMS equivalent for any Bison option, start with the long
option, and substitute a `/' for the leading `--', and substitute a `_'
for each `-' in the name of the long option.  For example, the
following invocation under VMS:

     bison /debug/name_prefix=bar foo.y

is equivalent to the following command under POSIX.

     bison --debug --name-prefix=bar foo.y

   The VMS file system does not permit filenames such as `foo.tab.c'.
In the above example, the output file would instead be named
`foo_tab.c'.

Bison Symbols
*************

`error'
     A token name reserved for error recovery.  This token may be used
     in grammar rules so as to allow the Bison parser to recognize an
     error in the grammar without halting the process.  In effect, a
     sentence containing an error may be recognized as valid.  On a
     parse error, the token `error' becomes the current look-ahead
     token.  Actions corresponding to `error' are then executed, and
     the look-ahead token is reset to the token that originally caused
     the violation.  *Note Error Recovery::.

`YYABORT'
     Macro to pretend that an unrecoverable syntax error has occurred,
     by making `yyparse' return 1 immediately.  The error reporting
     function `yyerror' is not called.  *Note The Parser Function
     `yyparse': Parser Function.

`YYACCEPT'
     Macro to pretend that a complete utterance of the language has been
     read, by making `yyparse' return 0 immediately.  *Note The Parser
     Function `yyparse': Parser Function.

     Macro to discard a value from the parser stack and fake a
     look-ahead token.  *Note Special Features for Use in Actions:
     Action Features.

`YYERROR'
     Macro to pretend that a syntax error has just been detected: call
     `yyerror' and then perform normal error recovery if possible
     (*note Error Recovery::.), or (if recovery is impossible) make
     `yyparse' return 1.  *Note Error Recovery::.

`YYERROR_VERBOSE'
     Macro that you define with `#define' in the Bison declarations
     section to request verbose, specific error message strings when

     examine this variable.  *Note Special Features for Use in Actions:
     Action Features.

`yyclearin'
     Macro used in error-recovery rule actions.  It clears the previous
     look-ahead token.  *Note Error Recovery::.

`yydebug'
     External integer variable set to zero by default.  If `yydebug' is
     given a nonzero value, the parser will output information on input
     symbols and parser action.  *Note Debugging Your Parser: Debugging.

`yyerrok'
     Macro to cause parser to recover immediately to its normal mode
     after a parse error.  *Note Error Recovery::.

     `yyparse'.)  *Note The Error Reporting Function `yyerror': Error
     Reporting.

`yyparse'
     The parser function produced by Bison; call this function to start
     parsing.  *Note The Parser Function `yyparse': Parser Function.

Glossary
********

Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
     Formal method of specifying context-free grammars.  BNF was first
     used in the `ALGOL-60' report, 1963.  *Note Languages and
     Context-Free Grammars: Language and Grammar.

Context-free grammars
     Grammars specified as rules that can be applied regardless of
     context.  Thus, if there is a rule which says that an integer can
     be used as an expression, integers are allowed *anywhere* an
     expression is permitted.  *Note Languages and Context-Free
     Grammars: Language and Grammar.

Dynamic allocation
     Allocation of memory that occurs during execution, rather than at
     compile time or on entry to a function.

Empty string
     Analogous to the empty set in set theory, the empty string is a
     character string of length zero.

Finite-state stack machine
     A "machine" that has discrete states in which it is said to exist
     at each instant in time.  As input to the machine is processed, the
     machine moves from state to state as specified by the logic of the
     machine.  In the case of the parser, the input is the language
     being parsed, and the states correspond to various stages in the
     grammar rules.  *Note The Bison Parser Algorithm: Algorithm.

Grouping
     A language construct that is (in general) grammatically divisible;
     for example, `expression' or `declaration' in C.  *Note Languages
     and Context-Free Grammars: Language and Grammar.

Infix operator
     An arithmetic operator that is placed between the operands on
     which it performs some operation.

Input stream
     A continuous flow of data between devices or programs.

Language construct
     One of the typical usage schemas of the language.  For example,
     one of the constructs of the C language is the `if' statement.
     *Note Languages and Context-Free Grammars: Language and Grammar.

Left associativity
     Operators having left associativity are analyzed from left to
     right: `a+b+c' first computes `a+b' and then combines with `c'.
     *Note Operator Precedence: Precedence.

Left recursion
     A rule whose result symbol is also its first component symbol; for
     example, `expseq1 : expseq1 ',' exp;'.  *Note Recursive Rules:
     Recursion.

Left-to-right parsing
     Parsing a sentence of a language by analyzing it token by token
     from left to right.  *Note The Bison Parser Algorithm: Algorithm.

Lexical analyzer (scanner)
     A function that reads an input stream and returns tokens one by
     one.  *Note The Lexical Analyzer Function `yylex': Lexical.

Lexical tie-in
     A flag, set by actions in the grammar rules, which alters the way
     tokens are parsed.  *Note Lexical Tie-ins::.

Look-ahead token
     A token already read but not yet shifted.  *Note Look-Ahead
     Tokens: Look-Ahead.

LALR(1)
     The class of context-free grammars that Bison (like most other
     parser generators) can handle; a subset of LR(1).  *Note
     Mysterious Reduce/Reduce Conflicts: Mystery Conflicts.

LR(1)
     The class of context-free grammars in which at most one token of
     look-ahead is needed to disambiguate the parsing of any piece of
     input.

Nonterminal symbol
     A grammar symbol standing for a grammatical construct that can be
     expressed through rules in terms of smaller constructs; in other
     words, a construct that is not a token.  *Note Symbols - Terminal
     and Nonterminal: Symbols.

Parse error
     An error encountered during parsing of an input stream due to
     invalid syntax.  *Note Error Recovery::.

Parser
     A function that recognizes valid sentences of a language by
     analyzing the syntax structure of a set of tokens passed to it
     from a lexical analyzer.

Postfix operator
     An arithmetic operator that is placed after the operands upon
     which it performs some operation.

Reduction
     Replacing a string of nonterminals and/or terminals with a single
     nonterminal, according to a grammar rule.  *Note The Bison Parser
     Algorithm: Algorithm.

Reentrant
     A reentrant subprogram is a subprogram which can be in invoked any
     number of times in parallel, without interference between the
     various invocations.  *Note A Pure (Reentrant) Parser: Pure Decl.

Reverse polish notation
     A language in which all operators are postfix operators.

Right recursion
     A rule whose result symbol is also its last component symbol; for
     example, `expseq1: exp ',' expseq1;'.  *Note Recursive Rules:
     Recursion.

Semantics
     In computer languages, the semantics are specified by the actions
     taken for each instance of the language, i.e., the meaning of each
     statement.  *Note Defining Language Semantics: Semantics.

Shift
     A parser is said to shift when it makes the choice of analyzing
     further input from the stream rather than reducing immediately some
     already-recognized rule.  *Note The Bison Parser Algorithm:
     Algorithm.

Single-character literal
     A single character that is recognized and interpreted as is.
     *Note From Formal Rules to Bison Input: Grammar in Bison.

Start symbol
     The nonterminal symbol that stands for a complete valid utterance
     in the language being parsed.  The start symbol is usually listed
     as the first nonterminal symbol in a language specification.
     *Note The Start-Symbol: Start Decl.

Symbol table
     A data structure where symbol names and associated data are stored
     during parsing to allow for recognition and use of existing
     information in repeated uses of a symbol.  *Note Multi-function
     Calc::.

Token
     A basic, grammatically indivisible unit of a language.  The symbol
     that describes a token in the grammar is a terminal symbol.  The
     input of the Bison parser is a stream of tokens which comes from
     the lexical analyzer.  *Note Symbols - Terminal and Nonterminal:
     Symbols.

Terminal symbol
     A grammar symbol that has no rules in the grammar and therefore is
     grammatically indivisible.  The piece of text it represents is a
     token.  *Note Languages and Context-Free Grammars: Language and
     Grammar.
