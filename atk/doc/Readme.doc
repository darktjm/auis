\chapter{ATK Documentation Library}



ATK documentation includes general documents, user help files, modules 
describing each class, tutorial modules discussing example programs.  The 
locations of these files in the installed system is described in the 
following paragraphs, where it is assumed that $ANDREWDIR is the root of 
the tree into which Andrew is installed (your site administrator and other 
Andrew users will know where this is).  A final section gives the file 
locations in the source.


Users may wish to begin with \


	ez $ANDREWDIR/doc/intro.d

The principal document reading tool for users is the 'help' program; 
 running it without an argument brings it up displaying a general overview, 
while running it with a specific argument starts it with help on that 
topic.  Help can view standard Unix 'man' documents as well as ATK 
documents.  The help files are installed in $ANDREWDIR/help/.


Modules describing each object class are in 
$ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/\italic{group}/, where group is named in accordance with 
the location of the source code.  For instance, view.doc is in 
$ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/basics/.  \



In the source code, help and doc files are stored along with the source 
code for the particular object class.  Since view.c is in 
$ANDREWSRC/atk/basics/common, that is also the location of view.doc.  Since 
eza.c, the application for ez, is in $ANDREWSRC/atk/ez/, the various 
ez\italic{xxxx}.help files are there as well.


A hardcopy version of the library set (which includes figures for the 
overview and examples) is available from the Andrew Consortium.  Refer
