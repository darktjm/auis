This is version 2.960904.  This is the integration of 2.960809 with the work done at CMU in support of the web browser and improved ez -> html conversion.

9-Aug-96
This is version 2.960809 of the HTML+ dataobject/view (which form the HTML+ editor/browser extension of EZ) and the accompanying datastream-to-HTML+ converter application (ez2html).

- To use the converter, ez2html must be an executable symlink to runapp.  Otherwise you must 'runapp ez2htmlapp'.
- To use the editor/browser dataobject, html.tpl must be available in your TEMPLATEPATH, and you must map a file extension in your ~/.ezinit like so:   addfiletype .html htmltext "template=html"
- The preference  "*.DefaultImage: /path/filename.gif"  should be set if you want unreadable images to appear as image insets.  globe.gif is included in this distribution for this purpose, but it doesn't get automatically installed anywhere.

-- Note that our template name (html.tpl) conflicts with the one used by Nick Williams's 'html' dataobject, so make sure you're getting ours.  Our global style forces a serif'ed "andy" font for the global style.
-- Tables, Footnotes, raw HTML+, and images (local files only, not remote URLs) are supported.
-- Read htmltext.help for instructions on using the editor.

This code is still under development, so before starting any significant modifications, or to get the latest version (Class-C or C++), contact Rob Kemmetmueller (rskm@vnet.ibm.com), alternate Todd Inglett (tinglett@vnet.ibm.com)



--Notable changes from v950519--
* Copy/Paste of insets won't crash, and will now retain attributes (especially important for image insets!)
* Raw HTML insets will size themselves reasonably now
* Handles example text in the template properly
* Really long spaceless tags won't crash anymore
* Output of defunct <plaintext> tag eliminated
* Supports &#99; symbol format
* ">" inside an SGML comment won't terminate the comment
* Supports <center> and <strike> tags, per HTML3.2 draft
* Cleaned up some <P> and <BR> writing anomalies
* <a></a> with no text inside it won't be discarded.  Also, a menu has been added to allow easy insertion of anchor-target style.

--Things to be done (in no particular order)--
* support NOFOLD, NOWRAP, JUSTIFY, etc attributes of <P> tag.
* get rid of defunct <LIT> literal tag support.
* subclass imageview, get rid of ugly chisel border, change origin so it won't drop down to baseline of surrounding text.
* add an option to turn <A> anchor tags into URLbutton insets instead of **anchor**-styled text.
* bugs: last newline of list style should not be wrapped when read; omitting it will make adding non-list text less problematic. crashes adding bullet to ordered list immediately after a nested unordered list.
* copy Nick's "title in subwindow" and "-set-title" features.
* word-break long paragraphs (except in <PRE> et al) for lame punch-card-based mailing systems and browsers.
* add a preference to determine where the local server (and hence ez) should look for images whose "src=" starts with "/".
* finish the code to support all the recognized tags that are currently commented-out. Only add menu definitions for styles that aren't "obsolete" in HTML 3.X.
* ez2html's helptopic->anchor convertor should support #fragmentIDs someday.  Few people use helptopic's sophisticated extensions anyway.
* add caption support to table/spread in base toolkit, then make htmltext use it.
* "frame-read-file" (evil base toolkit proc) shouldn't strip all the environments off.
* bug: pasting styled text into "Raw HTML" window results in a datastream being written.
* "Hide HTML Insets" should also affect insets inside table inset cells.
* add support to table for cellspacing, cellpadding, width hints, and other Netscapisms and HTML 3.2 things that were introduced recently.
* fix crash and renumbering bugs with nested lists.
