As a link user, you can easily navigate a set of Linked documents by using 
your left mouse button.

\heading{What is a Link?}

A link is an ATK Inset.  Hypermedia authors place Links in documents to 
help you locate additional information (if you'd like information on making 
your own linked documents, see

\view{linkview,538677704,18,0,0}).  By default, a link looks like a 
pushbutton.  However, you may set your "\typewriter{linkstyle}" preference 
to "0", which makes a link look like regular text, typically in 
\bold{Boldface} (although it may not be), (see

\view{linkview,538678488,19,0,0}).  The hypermedia author will usually give 
some kind of contextual indication that there is a link here, like "see 
such-and-such".  Also, the mouse cursor will change from a North-West arrow 
to a crosshairs sight cursor.


\heading{How do I use a Link?}

If you would like to follow the Link, just press your left mouse button 
over the link inset (i.e., anywhere in the region where the target cursor 
is visible).  The Link inset will then change the current window to show 
the referenced dcoument.  You may use the buffer commands like ^X^O to 
switch to documents previously seen.


\heading{What else should I know?}

To remove a window brought up by a link, remember to use "^X^D" (delete 
window), and not "^X^C" (quit application).


When a Link has the input focus, typing to it will cause the "Unkown 
command" message to appear.  If you want to type in your document, simply 
use the mouse to select a new insertion point.


Sometimes a Link inset won't have a target document.  In this case, 
pressing on the link will cause the message "No link." to be displayed.  It 
will also give the input focus to the link (see previous note).


There is a Link menu, which is meant for hypermedia authors.  You should 
ignore it.  If you accidentally select one of these menu items, "^G" should 
get you out of it.
