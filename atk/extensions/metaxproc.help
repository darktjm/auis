\chapter{Procedure Table Listing for metax}


\proclistentry{\procname{metax}(\proctype{view} \procparm{obj}, \proctype{null} | \proctype{0} | \proctype{marker} \procparm{argument})\
Executes a proctable function by name.  The 
\procparm{argument} (or 0, if not present) is passed on to the 
procedure.  Note that action-style procedures' arguments are 
interpreted as for binding, as described in the \helptopic{procs} overview.  
The type of the action's argument is assumed to be an integer if in the 
range of 0 to 255, and a string otherwise.\
This is pointless in Ness; just call the procedure directly.  
However, there may be some advantage to the support of parsing the 
string format of an action's arguments, in which case the argument 
string can be passed as \procparm{argument}, and the procedure 
name can be passed using \procname{QueueAnswer}.}

\proclistentry{\procname{metax-with-arg}(\proctype{view} \procparm{obj})\
Executes a function by name, prompting for an argument.  
Note that action-style procedures' arguments are interpreted as 
for binding, as described in the \helptopic{procs} overview.  The type 
of the action's argument is assumed to be an integer if in the range of 
0 to 255, and a string otherwise.\
This is pointless in Ness; just call the procedure directly.}
