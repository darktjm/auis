\bold{\bigger{image}}


The \bold{\italic{image}} class is a subclass of the \bold{\italic{dataobject}} 
class that performs two basics functions:


\leftindent{provide the loading from file of the various popular 
\underline{image file formats} and transformation into our internal 
\underline{image class structure}


provide the normal symantics normally associated with the dataobject class, 
such as; Read, Write, participate in the observer mechanism, and provide an 
interface for the manipulation of the actual image data

}
The internal image class structure is:


  unsigned int  type;   /* type of image */

  RGBMap        rgb;    /* RGB map of image if IRGB type */

  unsigned int  width;  /* width of image in pixels */

  unsigned int  height; /* height of image in pixels */

  unsigned int  depth;  /* depth of image in bits if IRGB type */

  unsigned int  pixlen; /* length of pixel if IRGB type */

  byte         *data;   /* data rounded to full byte for each row */


As such, this structure implies the permanent storage format of the image 
class.  The Write method will be responsible for compressing the internal 
format.  The Read method will uncompress this stored format.
