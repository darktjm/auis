Text is by far the most often-used ATK \italic{media type}, or \italic{inset}, 
although there are several others.


This document is an ATK \italic{text object}.  The contents of this text 
object are being displayed by a \italic{textview object}.  The text contains 
the sequence of words you are reading; the textview object contains knowledge 
about how to display text on the screen, and how to interact with it.


A textview object provides the sort of text-interaction methods you'd expect: 
 insert and delete; cut and paste; search and replace; etc.  Most of the 
interaction methods are \italic{bound} to keystrokes, mouse actions, or menu 
entries; that is, by typing the keystrokes, performing the mouse actions, or 
choosing the menu entries, you can execute the desired interaction methods. 
 Inserting the letter `a,' for example, into a text document that you are 
editing, is an interaction method bound to the keystroke `a.'  You can select 
a region of text by dragging the mouse pointer.  You can cut the selected 
region by choosing \bold{\bigger{\sans{Cut}}} from the menu, or by typing 
control-W.  (Although you can rebind textview commands to any keys you like, 
they are bound by default to an Emacs-like set of keystrokes.)


When you are editing an ATK text object with Ez (the Andrew inset-editing 
program), you have a fairly sophisticated document-creation tool at your 
fingertips.  Styled text can be laid out in many different ways, pictures and 
drawings can be embedded within, and there are facilities for automatic 
table-of-contents and index generation.  You can also insert pagebreaks and 
page headers/footers.


One command you won't find in many text editors is the Embed Inset command 
(bound to Escape-Tab).  This command allows you to insert any type of 
\italic{inset} by name in the current location in the document.
