Ness is a programming language for the Andrew ToolKit.  With it, documents 
can be processed and can even contain active elements controlled by Ness 
scripts.  The language features an innovative substring algebra for string 
processing.  \



This document is a tutorial description of the language itself.  If you are 
familiar with other programming languages, you may still benefit from 
reading the sections of this manual that describe the string algebra.  For 
a description of other Ness documentation, see \bold{Ness User's Manual}.

Ness programs are a collection of definitions of variables and functions. 
 For instance:


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{main}()

\leftindent{printline ("Hello, world")}

\italic{end} \italic{function}}}


When executed, this program will print "Hello, world" in the command window.


To execute a Ness program from a command window, give the nessrun command. 
 If the text above is in file hello.n, the command would be


\example{nessrun hello.n}


Nessrun compiles the program into an internal form and executes it by 
calling the function main().  The name \italic{main} is magic--Nessrun 
always calls it first.  \



If you want to pass parameters to main(), you can write a string after the 
name of the Ness program file:


\example{nessrun hello.n This is a string}


The string after the file name is passed as an argument to main().  To 
access it, main needs to declare an argument:


\example{\italic{function} \bold{main}(arg)

\leftindent{printline(arg)}

\italic{end} \italic{function}}


The printed output is a single line saying


\example{This is a string}


Ness programs can do arithmetic.  Here is a program to print the first few 
Fibonacci numbers:

\example{

\italic{integer} \italic{function} \bold{Fibonacci} (\italic{integer} x)

\leftindent{\italic{if} x <= 1 \italic{then} \


\leftindent{\italic{return} x}

\italic{else}

\leftindent{\italic{return} Fibonacci(x-1) + Fibonacci(x-2)}

\italic{end} \italic{if}}

\italic{end} \italic{function}


\italic{function} \bold{main}()

\leftindent{\italic{integer} i

i := 0

\italic{while} i <= 12 \italic{do}

\leftindent{printline(textimage(Fibonacci(i)))

i := i + 1}

\italic{end} \italic{while}}

\italic{end} \italic{function}}


With the above in file /tmp/fib.n, a typical execution would look like this:


\example{% \bold{nessrun /tmp/fib.n}

Execution okay.  Elapsed time is 280 msec.}


Items to note about the program:


*  Execution begins with a function named 'main'.


* The \bold{for} statement is currently not implemented, so it has to be 
simulated with a \bold{while} statement as shown in main().


* Since the Fibonacci function returns an integer value, it cannot be 
printed directly;  it must be converted to a string value by passing it to 
the function textimage(), which converts any value to an appropriate 
string.  (Plans are in the works for letting print() and printline() 
directly convert integer values to strings.)


* Function arguments and return values are by default subseq values, so the 
types must be explicitly declared \bold{integer} for Fibonacci() and its 
argument x.


* The algorithm shown is highly inefficient;  consider how many times 
Fibonacci(1) is computed.  The reader is invited to write and try a better 
version of this program.



\section{1. Program structure}


A Ness script is a sequence of declarations for variables, functions, and 
objects to be extended.


Variable declarations begin with the name of the type and then have a list 
of the names of the variables:


\example{\smaller{\italic{subseq} s, p, q

\italic{integer} i, j, count

\italic{real} height, weight

\italic{boolean} FirstTime := \italic{True}}}


These examples include the four most common data 
types.\footnote{\
\begindata{fnote,539040600}
\textdsversion{12}
\enddata{fnote,539040600}
\view{fnotev,539040600,14,0,0}In original Ness, subseq variables were 
declared with the type 'marker'.}  Variables may be initialized in their 
declaration, but then there can only be one name in the list.


Function declarations look like this


\example{\smaller{\italic{integer} \italic{function} \bold{square} 
(\italic{integer} a)

	\italic{return} a*a

\italic{end} \italic{function}}}


The function header gives the type returned by the function, the word 
'function', the function name, and a parameter list in parentheses.  The 
type may be specified as 'void' to indicate that nothing is returned. The 
parameter parentheses must appear even if there are no parameters:


\example{\smaller{\italic{void} \italic{function} \bold{main}()

	printline(textimage(square(3)))

\italic{end} \italic{function}}}


Program execution begins with the function named 'main'.  The preceding two 
examples constitute a program which prints '9'.


If there are multiple parameters, they are separated with commas and each 
must have the type name:


\example{\smaller{real function dist(real a, real b)

	return sqrt(a*a + b*b)

end function}}


Between the function header and the 'end function' may appear variable 
declarations and statements, but not more function declarations:


	\example{\smaller{\italic{void} \italic{function} \bold{quadroots} 
(\italic{real} a, \italic{real} b, \italic{real} c)

	\italic{real} disc, ba

	disc := b*b - 4.0*a*c

	ba := b/a/2.0

	\italic{if} disc > 0.0 \italic{then}

		printline("roots: " \


			~ textimage(ba + sqrt(disc)/a/2.0) \


			~ " \italic{and} " \


			~ textimage(ba - sqrt(disc)/a/2.0))

	\italic{end} \italic{if}

\italic{end} \italic{function}}}



\section{2. String Algebra}


String values in Ness are formally known as \italic{subseq} values because 
such a value does not actually denote a string, but rather refers to, or 
marks, a substring of an underlying base string.  A program can declare 
subseq variables:


\example{\smaller{\italic{subseq} s, m}

}
and assign them references to constants:


\example{\smaller{s := "abcdefg"

m := s}}


Now s refers to the entirety of the base string  a b c d e f g .  And m 
refers to the same.  This is a fundamental property of assignment of subseq 
values:  m \italic{does not} refer to a copy of \typewriter{s}--it refers 
to the \italic{same} base string as \typewriter{s}.  \



Four primitive functions start(), next(), base(), and extent() are provided 
for manipulating string values.  (Many additional functions are defined in 
terms of these primitives.)


\bold{start(x)}  -  The value of start of x is a subseq refering to a 
position between two characters.  In particular, the value refers to the 
position just before the start of the value referred to by x.  Suppose x 
refers to the substring  c d e  of the value  a b c d e f g  above, then 
the value of start of x is a subseq for the empty position between b and c.


\bold{base(x)}  -  Returns a subseq for the entire base string of which x 
refers to a part.  Suppose again that x refers to the substring  c d e  of 
the value  a b c d e f g ,  then the value of base(x) is a subseq referring 
to the entire value  a b c d e f g .


To get an empty mark at the beginning of the underlying base string for 
subseq p, you can use the composition of the functions start and base: 
 start(base(p)).   The opposite composition, base(start(p)), returns 
exactly the same value as base(p) because p and start(p) both refer to the 
same underlying base string.


\bold{next(x)}  -  This function returns a subseq for the character 
following the value marked by x.  When x is  c d e , next(x) is a subseq 
for f on the same base string.  If the argument x extends all the way to 
the end of its base string, then next(x) returns an empty mark for the 
position just after the last character of x.  \



Now we can write expressions for more interesting subsequences relative to 
a given mark t.  The first character \italic{after the beginning of t} is 
next(start(t)) because start(t) computes the empty subseq just before the 
first character and next() computes the character just after its argument. 
 Note the careful inclusion of the phrase "after the beginning of t"; 
 next(start(t)) does not compute the first character of t if t is a subseq 
for an empty substring--such a subseq has no characters and thus certainly 
no first character.


Similarly, the second character after the beginning of a given subseq t is 
next(next(start(t))) and the first character of the base is 
next(start(base(t))).


\bold{extent(x, y)}  -  Computes a subseq from two other subseqs on the 
same base.  The new subseq value extends from


	the beginning of the first argument,  x


to


	the end of the second argument,  y.


So if x is  c d e  in  a b c d e f g  and y is  b c d e f  then extent(x, 
y) will extend from just before c, the first character of x, until just 
after f, the last character of y;  the value will be c d e f.  The two 
arguments need not overlap or even be contiguous;  if x is  b c  and y is 
 e f  the value of extent(x,y) is b c d e f.  \



It may be that the first argument of extent() begins after the second ends. 
 In this case extent() is defined to return the a subseq for the empty 
position just after the \italic{second} argument.  Note that this position 
comes \italic{before} the beginning of the first argument.


Another possible problem with the arguments to extent() is that they may be 
on different base strings.  In this case, the value returned is a subseq on 
a unique base string whch has no characters.


With the aid of extent() we can write even more useful functions.  Suppose 
we really want the first character of a subseq;  the result should be empty 
if the argument subseq is empty.  We approach indirectly by first finding 
an expression for all characters after the first character of a subseq 
value.  Let t be the subseq value and assume for the moment it has at least 
one character.  From earlier work we know that the first character is given 
by next(start(t)) and the character after that by next(next(start(t))). 
 Now the sequence of all characters after the first character begins with 
that second character and extends to the end of t, so we can write the 
function rest():


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{rest}(t)

\leftindent{\italic{return}  extent(next(next(start(t))), t)}

\italic{end function}}}


Now imagine that the argument t for rest() has no characters.  The first 
argument to the extent function will be a subseq which begins after the end 
of t, the second argument;  so the result of the extent() will be the end 
of that second argument.  But since t is empty, the end of t is identical 
to t itself and the function rest() applied to an empty subseq returns a 
subseq equal to its argument.


With the aid of rest() we can compute the first character of a subseq:  it 
is the subseq which extends from the beginning of the original subseq up to 
the beginning of the rest().


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{first}(t)

\leftindent{\italic{return} extent(t, start(rest(t)))}

\italic{end function}}}


It may seem inefficient to compute first() and rest() by such round-about 
means, and it is.  These are simply formal definitions in terms of the four 
primitives start(), base(), next(), and empty();  in practice first() and 
rest() can be implemented more efficiently by writing them in the same low 
level language as is used for the primitives.



In Ness we can represent a set as a sequence of its elements and write an 
algorithm for all subsets.  The result is a sequence of subsets, each in 
parentheses.  For example, if the input is abc the result is 
(abc)(ab)(ac)(a)(bc)(b)(c)():


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{subsets}(s)

	\italic{if} s = "" \italic{then return} "()"		-- the empty subset

	\italic{else} \


		\italic{subseq} m := subsets(rest(s))	\


			-- m is all subsets of all but first element

		\italic{return} combine(first(s), m) ~ m	-- concatenate:

				-- all subsets of rest(s) \


				--    with first(s) inserted in each

				-- and all subsets of the rest(s)

	\italic{end if

end function


function} \bold{combine}(t, s)

	\italic{if} s = "()" \italic{then return} "(" ~ t  ~  ")"		-- t inserted 
in empty subset

	\italic{else} \


		\italic{subseq} m := extent(s, search(s, ")"))	-- first subset

		\italic{return} "(" ~ t ~ rest(m) 	-- t inserted in first subset

			~ combine(t, allnext(m))	-- t inserted in remaining subsets

	\italic{end if

end function}

}}
The second function, \bold{combine}, takes an element and a sequence of 
subsets and forms a new sequence of subsets with the element inserted in 
each subset.  This is utilized by the first function which initially splits 
its argument into a first element and a remainder, then finds all subsets 
of the remainder, and finally concatenates this list of subsets with the 
list generated by combining the first element with the subsets from the 
remainder.


\section{3. Search}


Search functions in Ness search through the base of their first argument 
looking for some substring described by the second argument.  The return 
value is a subseq referring to a substring of the first argument.  The 
sequence


\smaller{\example{\italic{subseq} m := "abcdef"

m := search(m, "cd")

printline(m)}}


will print \bold{cd}, but it will print a copy of the \bold{cd} within 
\italic{m}.  So if other string operations are applied to the result of the 
search, they will locate other text within \italic{m}.  Thus


\smaller{\example{\italic{subseq} m := "abcdef"

\italic{subseq} s

s := search(m, "cd")

printline(extent(next(s), m))

}}
will print \bold{ef}, the characters starting with \italic{next(s)} and 
extending to \italic{finish(m)}.

 \


By convention, the string searched is delimited by the precise details of 
the first argument:  If it is a zero-length substring, the search extends 
from it to the end of the base;  but if non-zero, the search occurs only 
within the substring delimited by that first argument.  For a search that 
does not succeed, the value returned is a zero-length subseq at the 
position of the end of the first argument.  Thus a first argument of 
start(x) differs from one of toend(x) in the location of the empty subseq 
returned for a failing search.


Two of the search functions, \italic{search}() and \italic{match}() treat 
their second argument as a string to be matched exactly in the first (white 
space and the case of characters must all match exactly).  The other three 
treat their second argument as a set of characters.  For instance, in the 
expression


\example{\smaller{anyof(toend(x), ".?!")}}


the set has three characters and the expression will return a subseq for 
the first character in base(x) after start(x) which is a period, question 
mark or exclamation point.  If there is no such character,  the expression 
returns an empty subseq at the end of toend(x), which is the end of base(x).


\description{\italic{search}(x, pat) - find the first instance of pat after 
start(x).


\italic{match}(x, pat) - match pat only if it begins at start(x).


\italic{anyof}(x, set) - find the first (single) character after start(x) 
that is one of the characters in the set.


\italic{span}(x, set) - match start(x) and all contiguous subsequent 
characters which are in the set.


\italic{token}(x, set) - find the first substring after start(x) which is 
composed of characters from set.  \


}
As an exercise in full understanding of the search conventions, here is a 
definition of token() written in Ness:


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{token}(x, set)

\leftindent{\italic{subseq} m := anyof (x, set)

\italic{if} m = "" \italic{then} 	\


\leftindent{-- there is no element of set

-- in the search area delimited by x}

\leftindent{\italic{return} m}

\italic{end if

if} x = ""\italic{ then}

\leftindent{-- we have to check from m to the end of base(x)

\italic{return} span(toend(m), set)}

\italic{else }\


\leftindent{-- the token must be between m and the end of x

\italic{return} span(extent(m, x), set)}

}\italic{\leftindent{end if}

end function}}}



\section{4. Concatenation}


Two string values can be concatenated with the tilde operator: \concat{~}

  \


	\example{\smaller{printline("first" ~ "second")}}


will print "firstsecond";  note that there is no space.  We can write 
another fibonacci function which generates a string of a fibonacci length:


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{fibonacci}(integer n)

\leftindent{\italic{if} n < 2 then return "*"  \italic{end if}

print(textimage(n) ~ " ")

\italic{return} fibonacci(n-2) ~ fibonacci(n-1)}

\italic{end function}

}}
From the call printline(fibonacci(5)), the value printed is


	5 3 2 4 2 3 2 ********


Concatenation always generates a new string value.  Indeed it is part of 
the definition of the copy() function:


\example{\smaller{\italic{function} \bold{copy}(x)

\leftindent{\italic{return} x ~ ""	-- to copy x, concatenate it to the 
empty string}

\italic{end function}}}



\section{5. Replacement}


In most applications it is sufficient to process an input string or file 
and construct the output by concatenation of the pieces of the input with 
other constants as needed.  Sometimes, however, for example when modifying 
the text displayed in an editor, it is prefereble to replace a piece of the 
text with some other text.  For this purpose Ness offers the 
\italic{replace}() function.  \



Replace(a, b) modifies the base string of a so the portion that was 
delimited by a now contains b.  The value returned is a subseq value 
referring to the new contents of the portion of a; even though the contents 
are a copy of b, they are not in the same base as b.  Thus the statements


\leftindent{\example{\smaller{\italic{subseq} m := copy("abcdef")

replace(next(next(start(m))), "QWE")}}

}
will give to m the value aQWEcdef.  Note that the first argument of replace 
cannot be a constant, so copy() was used to make a modifiable copy of 
"abcdef".


When a replace of subseq x is made within a base string, base(x), something 
must be done about all other subseqs that refer to portions of base(x). 
 Those that start before x and end after it will have there contents 
modified to include the new replacement characters.  Those that start after 
the end of x must be modified so they refer to the same characters as they 
did before.  More interesting cases occur for existing subseqs which 
overlap x.  In general the replacement is made as though the new text is 
inserted at the end of x and then the old x contents are deleted.  More 
precise rules can be derived from the examples in Table 1.


\leftindent{\formatnote{.ne 5.5i}


 Replace "\sans{efgh}" in  \sans{ abcd efgh ijkl}   with 
 "\italic{\sans{xyz}}"


	The substring   \sans{a / bc / defghijkl}   becomes   \sans{a / bc / 
d\italic{xyz}ijkl}

	The substring   \sans{a / bcd / efghijkl}   becomes   \sans{a / bcd /

  \sans{abcd\italic{xyz} / / ijkl}

    >	The substring   \sans{abcdefgh / i / jkl}   becomes 
  \sans{abcd\italic{xyz} / i / jkl}


 Replace empty string between \sans{c} and \sans{d} in   \sans{abcdef} 
  with   "\italic{\sans{xyz}}"


    <	The substring   \sans{a / bc / def}   becomes   \sans{a / bc / 
\italic{xyz}def}

	The substring   \sans{a / bcd / ef}   becomes   \sans{a / bc\italic{xyz}d

\italic{xyz}def}

    >	The substring   \sans{abc / d / ef}   becomes   \sans{abc\italic{xyz} 
/ d / ef}

	The substring   \sans{abcd / e / f}   becomes   \sans{abc\italic{xyz}d / e 
/ f}


}\indent{\bold{Table 1.  The effect of replace() on other subseqs.}  The 
replace performed for each group of lines is shown above the group.  Each 
line shows an example of some other subseq on the same base and its value 
after the replacement.  The base string is letters only; the spaces are for

general the replacement is made by inserting the replacement at the finish

examples where the other subseq ends at the end of the replaced string and 
the  >'s  indicates examples where it begins there.

}
\section{6. An Example}


The string processing sub-language is illustrated in the example below. 
 String values are formally known as \italic{subseq} values because they do 
not actually denote strings, but only refer to, or mark, substrings of 
underlying base strings.  The subseq variables in the example are 
\italic{letters}, \italic{text}, \italic{args}, and \italic{filename}.


Concatentation, with \concat{~}, of subseq values creates a brand new 
string value and returns a subseq referring to its entirety.  Subseq 
assignments assign only the reference and do NOT create a new string that 
is a copy of the old.  The functions token() and span() are built-in subseq 
functions which begin scanning at the start of their first argument and 
look for a string meeting the pattern in the second argument.  Span() scans 
its first argument and returns a subseq for the maximal initial substring 
consisting of characters in the second argument.  (The scan may extend 
beyond the end of the first argument.)  Token() is similar, but begins by 
skipping initial characters of the first argument until finding one from 
the second argument.

These demonstration files each contain an explanation of how to use them. 
 In general, they should be copied to /tmp before editing them with ez; 
 they must be read-write in order to display their effects.  (And if they 
are editted directly in $ANDREWDIR/lib/ness/demos, they leave .CKP files 
around charged against your account.)
